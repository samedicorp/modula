# modula

A modular script framework for Dual Universe.

## About

This is a rewrite of a private framework that I developed during the beta-years of Dual Universe.

I've been meaning to open-source it for ages, but with the upcoming release of the game, and the fact that the Lua scripting API is finally getting some love (leading to some changes), I've decided that a ground-up rewrite makes more sense.

This is that rewrite.
